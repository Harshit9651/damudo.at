          <h2>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h2>
          <p>The GDPR has provided the legislative foundation for the protection of personal data in Austria and the EU since 25 May 2018, thereby establishing a legal framework for a number of procedures that had long been common practice. In the period before it came into effect, the Austrian media played on people's fears by circulating a host of half-truths and worst-case scenarios. Our trained, certified consultants are more than happy to advise you on this regulation. They can give you practical tips that are easy and quick to implement, and show you that the GDPR is really nothing to fear.</p>
          <p>Our customised offering is tailored to your needs, and the icing on the cake comes in the form of an outsourced data protection officer. Depending on how you process particular types of data in your company, you might need to create this role in order to be compliant with the GDPR.</p>
